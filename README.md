# Smart-Image-Slider-App

I created this app for use by new develppers that needs to create some photo slides in a web app or website. 

The slider app is made smart and will work by just adding extra images to the html script under that class = "slider--" as you'll find.

JS inititalizes by assigning a position for all added images in the html, and then using a dataset attribute to make the app engine automatically assign the dot for 
all images it reads in the html script. This way developers that needs to use this can just add/replace their images in the html and JS takes it from there. 

CSS rule sets automatically set for all default class name so be careful when creating your own sets for this.
